# GRAVITY WARS!

This is a little game written in Jack for Chapter 9 of [The Elements of Computing Systems](http://www.nand2tetris.org/).

It supports up to 4 players, round-robin style. Each player starts a turn with a full energy bar.

![Action](https://github.com/jldowns/gravitywars/raw/master/gifs/gravitywars_action.gif)

Shooting and moving both use energy. A player's turn ends when she is out of energy.

Be careful, your EnergyBombs can hurt you too!
